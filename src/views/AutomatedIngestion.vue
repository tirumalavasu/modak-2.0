Moreover, generating a pipeline manually requires 2 hours. This leads to increase in implementation time. At Modak Analytics, pipelines are generated by Modakâ€™s Internal Proprietary tools in less than a minute. Hence, Modak can ingest huge amount of data in a short span of time and reduce the implementation time.',
