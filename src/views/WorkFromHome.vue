      The global pandemic scenario has disrupted and reshuffled workplaces at a breath-taking speed. Everyone currently is adapting to work from home (WFH) situation where each one of us are recording our meetings and conversations with our team members and colleagues in lieu of doing it in person. This pattern of life where we cannot step out of our homes and thrust into managing our work remotely has been draining and challenging both personally and work-wise. It gets difficult for many individuals to compose themselves in quarantine without face-to-face human interaction and the structure of a typical workday. It gets daunting sometimes to work under these conditions. In the interest of simplifying and making remote work both easier and productive, individuals can adapt to a few effective ways. So, here are a few small things you can do to make your remote work easier and productive.

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold mb-8 bg-yellow-300 text-black py-4">Communicate Frequently</h1>
    <p class="my-8 text-xl text-gray-900">
      The transition of employees working from synchronous and standardized environment to asynchronous and personalised environment is a bit alarming. According to sociometric research, frequent communication cycle proves to be more effective in building and sustaining morale of employees, in addition to their engagement. The communication platforms have made it simpler to stay in regular touch. This helps eradicate a sense of loneliness and gives a sense of being together with other colleagues. Audio and video conferences can turn their gloomy days into happy ones. The frequent communication also helps in resolving the issues at work with clear understanding and paves way in being more productive even in this unprecedented situation. Staying in regular touch not only aids in the performance of individuals at work, but also avails them in attaining a virtual companionship, which indirectly means to show up as a virtual team player.

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold mb-8 bg-yellow-300 text-black py-4">Focus on continued learning</h1>
    <p class="my-8 text-xl text-gray-900">
      The mundane work pattern keeps majority of us busy to focus on things we want to do. The routine has drifted us apart from our craving to learn new things, such as a speciﬁc technology, improve our skills or put some time into our personality development. This working from home scenario gives you a great opportunity to identify your interests and learning them. This allows individuals learn new technologies, skills and also deep dive into various subjects and expand their horizons.

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold mb-8 bg-yellow-300 text-black py-4 my-4">Maintain physical and social boundaries</h1>
    <p class="my-8 text-xl text-gray-900">
      Blake Ashforth of Arizona State University in one of his classic papers has described the ways in which people demarcate the transformation from work to non-work roles through ‘boundary crossing activities.’ Commuting to workplace, getting dressed up for work, interacting with colleagues over lunch and tea are a few social and physical indicators we do on daily basis. But, with the shifting of workplaces from office premises to homes, we might at first feel the change welcoming, as we do not have to wake up early and commute to work. But, eventually it gets difficult for many to compartmentalize the work and non-work lives. In order to maintain these boundaries while working from home, we can recreate same work routines like putting on our work clothes and replacing the commute by taking a small walk on the terrace or within apartment premises before starting the day at work. It is also recommended to just realign the things around you or change the workspace while working from home to maintain the boundaries.

    <h3 class="mx-auto text-center w-full my-4">One of the best practices to ensure the calmness of mind is meditation and Yoga</h3>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold mb-8 bg-yellow-300 text-black py-4">Gauge stress and engagement continually</h1>
    <p class="my-8 text-xl text-gray-900">
      Humans are social creatures. Being proactive at work, participating in trainings organised by organisations, dwelling and engrossing in work and helping family with household chores are some of the things individuals should try to do. Among other benefits, these things will help reduce stress and make individuals feel positive under the quarantine conditions.
    </p>
    <p class="my-8 text-xl text-gray-900">
      One of the best practices to ensure the calmness of mind is meditation and Yoga. It helps in soothing psychological needs. The workout and yoga sessions at home, along with meditation, will ensure physical and mental health for all of us while working during distancing. These situations demand every individual to be optimistic and to stay positive. At work, we can adapt good practices like greeting our colleagues at the beginning of our calls and meetings, check on each other, acknowledge their participation and contribution towards the completion of daily tasks. This acts as an uplifting factor in developing good rapport with the fellow colleagues and clinching on to their mental wellbeing.

    <h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold mb-8 bg-yellow-300 text-black py-4">Maintain work-life balance</h1>
    <p class="my-8 text-xl text-gray-900">
      The biggest challenge in this alignment of work is regarding the child-care or elderly-care responsibilities during regular work hours. The home responsibilities intertwine with that of the work and managing these responsibilities require creation of temporal boundaries. This often depends on the ability to coordinate one’s time with others. Individuals can share their responsibilities and assign a speciﬁc timing for child care or elderly care by discussing with their partners at home and managing the pace of work by doing the same with their colleagues and getting the tasks completed within stipulated deadlines. This calls for proper planning of the day, prioritisation of the work and multi-tasking when required with a view to achieve a sense of normality during this disruption.
